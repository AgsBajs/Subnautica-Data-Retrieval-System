# Subnautica-Data-Retrieval-System

We were instructed to use Java and OOP topics to create this project.
Subnautica is a vast ocean open world sand-box survival game that includes a broad view of plant and animal life.
I have created a flora and fauna data retrieval sytem that allows the user to type an animal or plant they want to learn about in the terminal, and it will give them information on it.
